# Procfile for development using HMR
# You can run these commands in separate shells
#
# Note: bin/dev runs precompile tasks (rescript + locale) BEFORE starting these processes.
# This ensures all generated files exist before webpack starts watching.
#
# ReScript watch mode (no clean - bin/dev already did the clean build)
rescript: yarn res:watch
# redis: redis-server  # Run Redis as a system service instead (brew services start redis)
rails: bundle exec thrust bin/rails server -p 3000
# Client webpack dev server with HMR
wp-client: RAILS_ENV=development NODE_ENV=development bin/shakapacker-dev-server
# Server webpack watcher for SSR bundle
