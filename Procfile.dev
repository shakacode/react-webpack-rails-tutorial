# Basic procfile for dev work.
# Runs all processes. Development is faster if you pick one of the other Procfiles if you don't need
# some of the processes: Procfile.rails or Procfile.express

# Development rails requires both rails and rails-assets
# (and rails-server-assets if server rendering)
rails: REACT_ON_RAILS_ENV=HOT rails s -b 0.0.0.0

# Run the hot reload server for client development
hot-assets: sh -c 'rm app/assets/webpack/* || true && HOT_RAILS_PORT=3500 npm run hot-assets'

# Render static client assets
rails-static-client-assets: sh -c 'npm run build:dev:client'

# Render static client assets. Remove if not server rendering
rails-static-server-assets: sh -c 'npm run build:dev:server'

# Run an express server if you want to mock out your endpoints. No Rails involved!
# Disable this if you are not using it.
# It's a great way to prototype UI especially with non-Rails developers!
express: sh -c 'HOT_PORT=4000 npm start'
