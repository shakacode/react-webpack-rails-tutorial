# Basic procfile for dev work.
# Runs all processes. Development is faster if you pick one of the other Procfiles if you don't need
# some of the processes: Procfile.rails or Procfile.express

# Development rails requires both rails and rails-assets
# (and rails-server-assets if server rendering)
rails: rails s
# Run the hot reload server for client development
rails-assets: sh -c 'rm app/assets/webpack/* || true && HOT_RAILS_PORT=3500 npm run build:dev:client'
# Keep the JS fresh for server rendering. Remove if not server rendering
rails-server-assets: sh -c 'npm run build:dev:server'

# If you don't keep this process going, you will rebuild the assets per spec run. This is configured
# in rails_helper.rb.
rails-spec: sh -c 'npm run build:test:client'

# Run an express server if you want to mock out your endpoints. No Rails involved!
# Disable this if you are not using it.
# It's a great way to prototype UI especially with non-Rails developers!
express: sh -c 'HOT_PORT=4000 npm start'
