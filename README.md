# React, Redux, Tailwind CSS, ES7, Webpack, Ruby on Rails Demo

* Server-Side Rendering of React via the [react_on_rails gem](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails)
* Live at [www.reactrails.com](http://www.reactrails.com/)

## Control Plane Deployment Example

[Control Plane](https://shakacode.controlplane.com) offers a viable, cost-saving alternative to Heroku, especially when using the [cpflow gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/cpflow) to deploy to Control Plane.

ShakaCode recently migrated [HiChee.com](https://hichee.com) to Control Plane, resulting in a two-thirds reduction in server hosting costs!

See doc in [./.controlplane/readme.md](./.controlplane/readme.md) for how to easily deploy this app to Control Plane.

The instructions leverage the `cpflow` CLI, with source code and many more tips on how to migrate from Heroku to Control Plane
in https://github.com/shakacode/heroku-to-control-plane.

## Basic Demo Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node `v22.3.0` or above. Be sure that you have Node installed! We suggest using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and running `nvm list` to check the active Node version. See this article [Updating and using nvm](http://forum.shakacode.com/t/updating-and-using-nvm/293).
- Ruby 3.3.3 or above
- Postgres v9.2 or above
- Redis. Check that you have Redis installed by running `which redis-server`. If missing and on MacOS, install with Homebrew (`brew install redis`)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

### Setup
1. `git clone git@github.com:shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial.git`
1. `cd react-webpack-rails-tutorial`
1. `bundle install`
1. `yarn`
1. `rake db:setup`
1. `rails start`
    - Open a browser tab to http://localhost:3000 for the Rails app example

### Basic Command Line
- Run all linters and tests: `rake`
- See all npm commands: `yarn run`
- To start all development processes: `foreman start -f Procfile.dev`
- To start only all Rails development processes: `foreman start -f Procfile.hot`

## Rails Integration
**We're now using Webpack for all Sass and JavaScript assets so we can do CSS Modules within Rails!**

+ **Production Deployment**: [heroku-deployment.md](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/blob/master/docs/additional-reading/heroku-deployment.md).
   + Configure Buildpacks
      ```
      heroku buildpacks:set heroku/ruby --app your-app
      heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 heroku/nodejs --app your-app
      heroku buildpacks:set --index 3 https://github.com/sreid/heroku-buildpack-sourceversion.git --app your-app
      ```

## Testing
+ See [Yak Shaving Failing Integration Tests with React and Rails](https://blog.shakacode.com/yak-shaving-failing-integration-tests-with-react-a93444886c8c#.io9464uvz)

+ Be sure to see [Integration Test Notes](./docs/integration-test-notes.md) for advice on running your integration tests.

+ **Testing Mode**: When running tests, it is useful to run `foreman start -f Procfile.spec` in order to have webpack automatically recompile the static bundles. Rspec is configured to automatically check whether or not this process is running. If it is not, it will automatically rebuild the webpack bundle to ensure you are not running tests on stale client code. This is achieved via the `ReactOnRails::TestHelper.configure_rspec_to_compile_assets(config)`
line in the `rails_helper.rb` file. If you are using this project as an example and are not using RSpec, you may want to implement similar logic in your own project.

## Webpack and Rspack

_Converted to use Shakapacker with support for both Webpack and Rspack bundlers_.

This project supports both Webpack and Rspack as JavaScript bundlers via [Shakapacker](https://github.com/shakacode/shakapacker). Switch between them by changing the `assets_bundler` setting in `config/shakapacker.yml`:

```yaml
# Use Rspack (default - faster builds)
assets_bundler: rspack

# Or use Webpack (classic, stable)
assets_bundler: webpack
```

### Performance Comparison

Measured bundler compile times for this project (client + server bundles):

| Build Type | Webpack | Rspack | Improvement |
|------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Development | ~3.1s | ~1.0s | **~3x faster** |
| Production (cold) | ~22s | ~10.7s | **~2x faster** |

**Benefits of Rspack:**
- 67% faster development builds (saves ~2.1s per incremental build)
- 51% faster production builds (saves ~11s on cold builds)
- Faster incremental rebuilds during development
- Reduced CI build times
- Drop-in replacement - same configuration files work for both bundlers

_Note: These are actual bundler compile times. Total build times including package manager overhead may vary._

### Configuration Files

All bundler configuration is in `config/webpack/`:
- `webpack.config.js` - Main entry point (auto-detects Webpack or Rspack)
- `commonWebpackConfig.js` - Shared configuration
- `clientWebpackConfig.js` - Client bundle settings
- `serverWebpackConfig.js` - Server-side rendering bundle
- `development.js`, `production.js`, `test.js` - Environment-specific settings

### Additional Resources
- [Webpack Docs](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Webpack Cookbook](https://christianalfoni.github.io/react-webpack-cookbook/)
- Good overview: [Pete Hunt's Webpack Howto](https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto)

## Sass, CSS Modules, and Tailwind CSS Integration
This example project uses mainly Tailwind CSS for styling.
Besides this, it also demonstrates Sass and CSS modules, particularly for some CSS transitions.

We're using Webpack to handle Sass assets so that we can use CSS modules. The best way to understand how we're handling assets is to close follow this example. We'll be working on more docs soon. If you'd like to give us a hand, that's a great way to learn about this!

For example in [client/app/bundles/comments/components/CommentBox/CommentBox.jsx](client/app/bundles/comments/components/CommentBox/CommentBox.jsx), see how we use standard JavaScript import syntax to refer to class names that come from CSS modules:

```javascript
import css from './CommentBox.module.scss';

export default class CommentBox extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { actions, data } = this.props;
    const cssTransitionGroupClassNames = {
      enter: css.elementEnter,
      enterActive: css.elementEnterActive,
      exit: css.elementLeave,
      exitActive: css.elementLeaveActive,
    };
  }
}
```

### Fonts with SASS
The tutorial makes use of a custom font OpenSans-Light. We're doing this to show how to add assets for the CSS processing. The font files are located under [client/app/assets/fonts](client/app/assets/fonts) and are loaded by both the Rails asset pipeline and the Webpack HMR server.

## Process management during development
```
bundle exec foreman start -f <Procfile>
```

1. [`Procfile.dev`](Procfile.dev): Starts the Webpack Dev Server and Rails with Hot Reloading.
1. [`Procfile.static`](Procfile.dev-static): Starts the Rails server and generates static assets that are used for tests.

[The Shaka Code team!](http://www.shakacode.com/about/), led by [Justin Gordon](https://github.com/justin808/), along with with many others. See [contributors.md](docs/contributors.md)

### RubyMine and WebStorm
Special thanks to [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) for their great tools: [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) and [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). Some developers of this project use RubyMine at the top level, mostly for Ruby work, and we use WebStorm opened up to the `client` directory to focus on JSX and Sass files.

### Hiring

We're looking for great developers that want to work with Rails + React (and react-native!) with a remote-first, distributed, worldwide team, for our own products, client work, and open source. [More info here](http://www.shakacode.com/about/index.html#work-with-us).
